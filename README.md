# E-Commerce Stock Prediction
In this 21st century the e commerce markets are booming and new startups are emerging more commonly like never before which are becoming very successful companies in a decade . Meanwhile some investors want to invest in many e-commerce companies but they kinda wave between thoughts , Like Should I invest in this company ? What if I lose all my money ? How well did the companyâ€™s stock perform in the previous years ?. So , it would be better if we had a software which can predict and forecast the stocks of the companies based upon the previous performances of the stock data . This is  one of many ways for us to  get a guess of what the upcoming stock market  of the e commerce world would look like . So , in this project by using the Facebook - Prophet library we are forecasting the stock conditions of some famous e commerce companies like (Amazon, Ali Baba, Ebay, Walmart , Costco, Best Buy , The Home Deport , Etsy) So that the investors can  invest in stocks with more clarity and with confidence . Our stock predictor usees yahoo finance to get our stock data from previous years until our present day . Then the stock predictor uses python as a de-facto language . It was built with the help of streamlit then hosted by using streamlitshare.io its a free app sharing platform
